# BlockStorage

## Project Description
BlockStorage is a simple decentralized application (dApp) smart contract that allows users to store, update, and retrieve text-based information securely on the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures transparency, immutability, and ownership of stored data.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a lightweight, decentralized storage solution where individuals can store essential data without relying on centralized servers. This project demonstrates the foundation of building a blockchain-based data storage system.

## Key Features
- **Data Storage:** Users can store string data directly on-chain.
- **Personal Data Retrieval:** Each user can access the data they stored.
- **Public Lookup:** Anyone can look up the data stored by another address.
- **Event Logging:** Every storage action emits an event for tracking.

## Future Scope
- Add functionality to delete or update stored data.
- Support for multiple data entries per user.
- Integration with IPFS/Arweave for large file storage.
- Frontend interface using React and Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- Role-based access control and permissions.
